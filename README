Uses a JS closure to contain an HTML "object" comprising a parent <ul> with two child <li> elements and one image. The closure exposes:
1. The parent <ul>
2. The innerText of the two <li> elements and
3. The image URL (i.e. the src attribute).
The innerText and imageURL can be set after the "object" has been created.
